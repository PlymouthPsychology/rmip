#### 2025 comment (JB)
## Workshop 2 is slightly higher, workshop 1 slightly lower, both within one s.d. on the overall mean,

#### 2024 comment (AW)
## Workshop 3 is slightly higher, and is within about one s.d. on the overall mean, 
## and N = 12, so let's leave it. 

#### 2022 comment (AW)
## Although Workshop 1 is slightly higher, the difference is small and given that each
## workshop is an N of 12, some variation is expected.
## Also, workshop 1 is lower mainly because of one very poorly performing group (score = 1.33)

## No statistical moderation required at workshop level.

## Ignore workshop grouping from here on

#### 2025 comment (JB)
## five A-, one A, most groups are B- or B. Seems reasonable

#### 2024 comment (AW)
## Largely same above as previous years. Had to add an A+ for exceptional group
## Had to set B- Descriptively rather than -1 s.d. as latter was lower than C+ this year.

## 3 students on the DLE are not in the group list:
## - AA: has not been attending for a while
## - CH: has not been attending for a while
## - MS: passed the module during 2024 referrals
## 2 students in attendance list, but not marked as students on DLE.

## and S4 indicates that they have withdrawn, so remove them

## Three students we have aren't on DLE. From S4:
## So we shouldn't return a mark for those
## Removed from CSV files

##### 2024 comment (AW)
## One student is LIVE on S4 but is missing from our group lists. 
## We should not return a mark for her

##### 2022 comment (AW)
## Differs by two students. One has interrupted, the other is in Stage 4
## We should not return a mark for either.

## Who was absent?

## Time to return marks to DLE

## 1. Remove those with approved ECs and who were actually absent (will have to take care of those at referrals)
ec.approved  <- ec.comb %>% filter(EC_presented == 1 & EC_type %in% c("non-submission","non-attendance"))
print(ec.approved, n = Inf)
final  <- grps.dle |> filter( !(PU_email %in% ec.approved$PU_email))

## 2. Combine group marks with individual students
all.marks  <- final %>% full_join(scores, by = "Group_ID")

## 3. Where student was not present, change mark to zero
all.marks$mark[all.marks$present == 0]  <- 0
length(which(all.marks$mark == 0))

## 4. Reduce to necessary columns and rename
all.marks  <- all.marks %>% select(`Email address`, mark)
colnames(all.marks)  <- c("Email address", "Graded")  # Use "Graded" instead of "Grade" here to avoid automatic renaming of the variables when left_joining below

## 5. Insert marks in PSYC720 spreadsheet
return720  <- dle720 %>% left_join(all.marks, by = "Email address")
return720$Grade  <- return720$Graded
return720  <- return720 %>% select(-Graded)
return720$`Feedback comments`  <- "" # replace NAs by empty strings because we don't want to see "NA" in the DLE feedback
nrow(return720)

## 6. Save out as CSV for upload to DLE
write_csv(return720, "return720.csv")

## 7. Same rigmarole for PSYC520
return520  <- dle520 %>% left_join(all.marks, by = "Email address")
return520$Grade  <- return520$Graded
return520  <- return520 %>% select(-Graded)
return520$`Feedback comments`  <- "" # replace NAs by empty strings because we don't want to see "NA" in the DLE feedback
return520$Marker  <- ""
