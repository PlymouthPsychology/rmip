## Presentation mark moderation and distribution
## Andy Wills,  GPL 3

## Notes for future years
## 1. Start feedback comments with a capital letter.
## 2. Try to avoid spelling and grammatical errors!
## 3. Avoid non-standard abbreviations (e.g. "dep variable")
## 4. If it's a question, use a question mark.
## 5. Group_IDs have to match between the group and feedback files you send me! Only MV did this.
## 6. It's really important you don't misspell the Components  e.g. "Clairty of speech", because the script will treat these as different components!

## MV: Row 39: Comment incomplete, I have added text for students to talk to you for clarification

## MV: 1_07: Advice on next steps - Zero is not a valid score. I have inserted 3. It's too late to change this now, hopefully not a major issue.

## Calculate overall scores

## is necessary

## Ignore workshop grouping from here on
