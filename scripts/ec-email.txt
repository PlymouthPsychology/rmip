Hello,

My records indicate that you did not attend your group presentation for PSYC520 / PSYC720 last week. This means that a score of zero is currently recorded for you for this assessment. Here's what you have to do to get that changed. Please read this email carefully as, due to coronavirus, some of the directions have changed relative to what you may previously have been told:

1. If there were Extenuating Circumstances (EC) that led to your absence, you must make a formal application to the Faculty to have these recognised - details of how to do this are in your student handbook, which is available on your programme page on the DLE ("Moodle"). If you have already made an application for this specific assessment, you do not need to make it again. If you have already received formal notification your ECs have been approved, you can assume I am aware of this.

2. If your ECs have been approved, you must submit, via the DLE, an audio-narrated PowerPoint of your presentation by 12 noon on Thursday 26th March. This is an individual assessment i.e. your audio narration should be for the whole presentation. Here's a tutorial on how to do an audio-narrated presentation in PowerPoint:

If you have queries about this message, you may direct them to me.

Yours
