Hello,

My records indicate that you did not attend your group presentation for PSYC520 / PSYC720, and that you further did not submit an audio-narrated PowerPoint to the DLE by the Extenuating Circumstances deadline. 

This means that a score of zero is recorded for you for this assessment, which is 20% of your overall mark for this module.

If there were Extenuating Circumstances (EC) that led to your absence and non-submission, you must make a formal application to the Faculty to have these recognised - details of how to do this are in your student handbook, which is available on your programme page on the DLE ("Moodle"). If you have already made an application for this specific assessment, you do not need to make it again. If you have already received formal notification your ECs have been approved, you can assume I am aware of this.

If you have queries about this message, you may direct them to me.

Yours

Andy Wills
