## Although Workshop 1 is slightly higher, the difference is small and given that each
## workshop is an N of 12, some variation is expected.

## Time to return marks to DLE

## 1. Treat those successfully completing EC and with EC approval as if they were present
final  <- grps
final$present[final$PU_email %in% ec.success$PU_email]  <- 1

## 2. Combine group marks with individual students
all.marks  <- final %>% full_join(scores, by = "Group_ID")

## 3. Where student was not present, change mark to zero
all.marks$mark[all.marks$present == 0]  <- 0

## 4. Reduce to necessary columns and rename
all.marks  <- all.marks %>% select(`Email address`, mark)
colnames(all.marks)  <- c("Email address", "Graded")

## 5. Insert marks in PSYC720 spreadsheet
return720  <- dle720 %>% left_join(all.marks, by = "Email address")
return720$Grade  <- return720$Graded
return720  <- return720 %>% select(-Graded)
return720$`Feedback comments`  <- ""

## 6. Save out as CSV for upload to DLE
write_csv(return720, "return720.csv")

## 7. Same rigmarole for PSYC520
return520  <- dle520 %>% left_join(all.marks, by = "Email address")
return520$Grade  <- return520$Graded
return520  <- return520 %>% select(-Graded)
return520$`Feedback comments`  <- ""

## 8. Remove students who are Uni system admin errors by hand
## (Scripting would put the names into repo, which is not good)
