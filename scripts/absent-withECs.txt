Hello,

My records indicate that you did not participate in your group presentation last week. As your claim for extenuating circumstances has been approved, you will be allowed to attempt this assessment again during the referral period.

You will get an email from the assessment board at the end of June/early July telling you your new deadline, which is likely to be in August. By that deadline you must submit, via the DLE, an audio-narrated PowerPoint of your presentation. This is an individual assessment i.e. your audio narration should be for the whole presentation. Here's a tutorial on how to do an audio-narrated presentation in PowerPoint:

Let me know if you have any question,

Best,

Julien
