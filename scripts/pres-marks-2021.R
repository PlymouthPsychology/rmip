## feedback: No empty rows!

## feedback: Feedback: "NA" is not an appropriate. comment. I have inserted "No
## feedback recorded - query with group leader"

## Also, groups X6, W6, W7, Z1, Z3, Z4, Z7 had the wrong number of entries -
## missing "Advice on next steps" row!

## For two groups, over-long presentation was commented on in "advice on next
## steps". This is not the intent of this section, which is to advise them on
## what to do next in this module --- obviously they won't be giving another
## presentation for us. I've moved these comments to 'clarity of speech'.

## Grammar!

## structured cleared - > structured more clearly

## However, not it would have been good -> remove not

## You could also some time linkng your findings  -> add "spend"

## feedback: Feedback: Sentences begin with a captial letter!

## feedback: Feedback: "Clairty of speech", "Advice on next Steps" !!

## Load feedback and marks, manuall corrected, back in

## workshop is an N of 7 or 8, some variation is expected.
## No statistical moderation required at workshop level.
