Hello,

My records indicate that you did not attend your group presentation for PSYC520 / PSYC720 last week. As I have not received confirmation of an approved extenuating circumstances claim, this means that a score of zero is currently recorded for you for this assessment.

If there were Extenuating Circumstances (EC) that led to your absence, you must make a formal application to the Faculty to have these recognised - details of how to do this are in your student handbook, which you can find on your course DLE. If you have already made an application for this specific assessment, you do not need to make it again. If you have already received formal notification your ECs have been approved, please forward it to me.

If your ECs are approved, you will get an email from the assessment board at the end of June/early July telling you your new deadline, which is likely to be in August. By that deadline you must submit, via the DLE, an audio-narrated PowerPoint of your presentation. This is an individual assessment i.e. your audio narration should be for the whole presentation. Here's a tutorial on how to do an audio-narrated presentation in PowerPoint:

Let me know if you have any question,

Best,

Julien
