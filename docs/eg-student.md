# Sample set of submissions

_2021 Edition_

Below are a complete set of submissions, plus marking criteria and feedback for an imaginary student on this module. 

This imaginary student selected a sub-topic on test-potentiated learning ([Potts & Shanks, 2014](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1399515/1/RPottsLastRevision.pdf)) in long-term memory research. This sub-topic was picked for this example because it's one not currently available to students taking this module. The assumption is that the student completed this project in 2018, and hence before the publication of [Seabrooke et al. (2019)](https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10026.1/14653/tpl-motivation-accepted.pdf?sequence=1).

## Lab book (aka PsycEL)

Weeks indicate the weeks that the activities _open_. No activity closes until the last possible moment in the semester. Model answers are given here for illustration, they should **not** appear on PsycEL. 

The operation of this lab book is more like the PsycEL activities of PSYC412 etc, rather than the rather labour-intensive manual checking system tried in PSYC519. Exercises are marked as 'complete' (i.e. passed) if the material uploaded / pasted meets certain syntatical requirements that can be automatically checked on the server side.
