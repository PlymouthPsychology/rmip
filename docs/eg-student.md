# Sample set of submissions

Below are a complete set of submissions, plus marking criteria and feedback for an imaginary student on this module. 

This imaginary student selected a sub-topic on test-potentiated learning ([Potts & Shanks, 2014](link)) in long-term memory research. This sub-topic was picked for this example because it's one not currently available to students taking this module. The assumption is that the student completed this project in 2018, and hence before the publication of [Seabrooke et al. (2019)](link).
