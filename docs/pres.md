# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

## Week 7: Give group presentation

### High intensity and low intensity sessions

All the sessions this week are identical -- each is staffed by one TA and one
Teacher (who double mark). In each workshop, up to 7 groups present. 10 minute
presentations, 3 min for questions and informal feedback, 2 min for switch
over. Just about fits into a 2 hour session.

## Homework

- Submit presentation slides.
