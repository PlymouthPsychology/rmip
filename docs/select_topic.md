- Read and discuss the assigned papers. There are three papers, so each paper gets read by two people.

- Complete the worksheets.

- Do the first part of the [preprocessing](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/preproc.html) worksheet, up to and including running the facial prototypes experiment on yourself.
