# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2)

## Teachers' notes: Pre-module prep

One week before the first class, students must be emailed and requested to:

1. Check they can log in to RStudio Server, and request login details from the Tech Office if they cannot.

2. Complete the R [revision worksheet](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/revision.html), as the module assumes this information will be fresh in their mind. It should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

3. Bring their laptop to every session if they have one, ensuring they have at least a few GB of space left on their hard drive. A limited number of laptops are available for loan to those who do not have one.
