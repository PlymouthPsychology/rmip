# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2)

## Teachers' notes: Pre-module prep

One week before the first class, students must be emailed and requested to:

1. Check they can log in to RStudio Server, and request login details from the Tech Office if they cannot.

2. Revise Part 1 of the [Absolute Beginners' Guide to R](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/), as the module assumes this information will be fresh in their mind.

3. Bring their laptop to every session if they have one, ensuring they have at least a few GB of space left on their hard drive. A limited number of laptops are available for loan to those who do not have one.
