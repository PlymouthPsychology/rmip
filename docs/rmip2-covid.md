# Research Methods in Practice 2

_Andy Wills, Clare Walsh, Chris Longmore, Michael Verde_

In this course, you'll get a guided introduction to doing research as a team. You'll pick a topic (from a list), plan a study, build an experiment, collect data, analyze that data, and give a group presentation on your initial findings. You'll then modify your design in response to feedback, and write up the whole thing in journal article format. The focus is on learning a few techniques well. You'll learn how to do good, open, reproducible science, and you'll be well prepared for the research methods components of your final year. 

## Before the course begins

One week before this course begins, you must:

1. Check you can log into [RStudio online](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk), and resolve this issue with the Tech Office if you cannot.

2. Complete the R [revision worksheet](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/revision.html), as this course assumes this particular information will be fresh in your mind. It should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.

If you ever want to look back at earlier materials on R, you can find them all on the main [RMINR](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr) site. On that site, Part 1 and 2 are the Stage 1 materials, Part 3 is a a briefer version of Stage 1 for revision purposes, and Parts 4 and 5 are the Stage 2 materials.

Discussion
	We successfully improved overall performance on the cued recall test, relative to Experiment 1, but still did not find evidence for a benefit of errorful generation on cued recall.
