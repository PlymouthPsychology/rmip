Weeks indicate the weeks that the activities _open_. The activity closes at the end (23:59) of the Friday of the week after the week it opened. So, for example, if it opened in Week 1, then it would close Friday of Week 2.

After an activity has closed, the student must request their personal tutor to re-open it for them. This serves the function of giving personal tutors an early-warning of lack of progress on the part of their tutees. 

When an activity is reopened, it reopens for two weeks, or until the final deadline, whichever is sooner. So, for example, if the tutor reopens on May 9 and the final deadline is May 12, the it only reopens until May 12. 

**The final deadline is the same day as the deadline for the main report**

Beyond that deadline, only the module leader can reopen the activities, and this should only be done once it's made clear to the student that they should apply for Extenuating Circumstances.
