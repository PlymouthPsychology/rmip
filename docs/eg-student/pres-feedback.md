# Group presentation: Feedback and marking sheet

Your group's presentation was marked independently by two markers, who then agreed the following scores and feedback. The overall mark for each group was calculated by taking the mean across the nine scores below. The module leader took the set of overall marks, moderated them, and converted them to the grade you see below. This was done with reference to the generic marking criteria you can find in your Stage handbook.
**The mark awarded is for your group. Every member of the group who attended their group's presentation gets this mark. Failure to attend results in a mark of zero.**
