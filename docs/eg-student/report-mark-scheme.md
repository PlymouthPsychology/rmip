# Mark scheme for main report

Markers assess each report against each of the following criteria, using a five-point scale in each case (Poor, Patchy, OK, Good, Excellent). These scores are used by the marker to provide feedback comments throughout your report, and also some overall comments.

For each student, the module leader takes an average of these scores to generate an overall score for that student. These average scores are then moderated and converted to letter-grade scores (A+ through to N) using the generic definitions available in the Stage handbook. Where page limits have been exceeded, the module leader penalises the letter-grade marks as set out in the Stage handbook.
