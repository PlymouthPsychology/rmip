# Bullet point plan for The Rokers

- Introduction

	- Introduce testing effect
	
	- What about when test performance is poor?
	
	- Description of Potts and Shanks results
	
	- Potts and Shanks may be due to familiarity, not associative learning
	
	- Cued recall shows associative learning
	
	- Follow up Potts and Shanks with cued recall
	
- Experiment 

	- Method as per protcol document
	
	- Results as per presentation
	
		
- Discussion

	- Summary of findings
	
		- No effect in either condition
		
		- Bayesian evidence for null in hard text, but floor effect
		
		- Performance better in easy test, but inconclusive Bayes.
		
	- Relation to literature / Implications
	
		- Different to Potts and Shanks results
		
		- This likely due to multi-choice vs. cued recall testing
		
		- Perhaps errorful generation boosts familiarity, not associative learning.
		
		- In applied contexts, associative learning is the critical aspect.
		
	- Limitations / extensions
	
		- Weakness of evidence: Floor effect / Bayesian inconclusive
		
		- At d = 0.34 effect size (estimated from easy test), sample size should be 55+ for adequate power.
		
		- Run a large-scale replication of easy test
		
		- Presentation time of word-definition pairs not matched between conditions
		
			- Also true from Potts and Shanks, but less of a problem for them than for us, given their results.
			
			- Run a version that equates pair presentation time between conditions
			
	- Brief conclusion
