# Data upload 2

Upload your group's full data set for your second experiment / condition. This must be as a single ZIP archive file.

No model data available as yet.

_AUTO MARK_: It must be a .zip file. It's hard to be specific about file size, because it depends on their study. I would estimated not more than about 3 MB uncompressed, and it's quite compressible. But still, for safety, perhaps set a 5MB limit.
