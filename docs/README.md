# Research Methods in Practice

_2025 edition_

**Written by:** _Andy Wills, Chris Longmore, Clare Walsh, Michael Verde and Julien Besle_


Students on this module get a guided introduction to doing research as a team. Across 12 weeks, they go through one cycle of a research project. They pick a topic, plan a study, build an experiment, collect data, analyze that data, and give a group presentation on their findings. They critically evaluate their work, and write up the whole thing in journal article format. 

The module focusses on learning relatively few key techniques, and giving students lots of practice in those techniques -- learning by doing. It teaches students how to do good, open, reproducible science.
