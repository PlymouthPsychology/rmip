# OpenSesame experiment check list

Each experiment osexp file should meet all the items on this checklist before beign converted to a JATOS file and uploaded to JATOS.

- Experiments takes no longer than 15 minutes to run. Check with a stopwatch.

- Open Sesame script runs from beginning to end without crashing, and runs as expected.

- log file (.csv) contains all the information necessary for the analysis (e.g. the participant's response, the stimulus name, the condition for both the within- and between- experimental factors)

- if there are different blocks of conditions within a single experiment, all dataloggers have a same unique name

- if two separate osexp files are used for separate groups, make sure the experiments only differ by the experimental manipulation and everything else is identical.

- Participant is instructed to press the space bar on the last screen (without this, the data might not save correctly)
