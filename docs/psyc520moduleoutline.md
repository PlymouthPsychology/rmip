# PSYC520: Research Skills in Practice 2: Module Outline

**Credit Weighting:**	20 Credits
**Module Leader:** Andy Wills
**Teaching Staff:**	Chris Longmore, Michael Verde, Clare Walsh.

**Aims**:	The module aims to support students through a simple research cycle and deliver a 
basic understanding of the research process in psychology before engaging with an 
advanced-research cycle. Statistical analysis techniques are taught in workshops with the aim 
of providing the student with an understanding of the analysis procedures appropriate to a 
range of research designs for testing differences. In addition, the module aims to introduce 
students to issues in conducting psychological research such as research project management.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Develop a simple research question with a high level of guidance from a supervisor and 
translate it into a study, then develop a more complex design to address issues arising 
from the first study.

2. Develop a basic understanding of the importance of ethical issues in research.

3. Understand the basic principles of research management.

4. Run, analyse, evaluate, and report psychological research.

5. Analyse the results of studies using multifactorial ANOVA, and relate them to the relevant 
literature that motivated the work.

6. Execute the statistical methods taught and interpret the output.

7. Communicate the outputs of research through written and oral presentation means.

## Teaching Arrangements

Two two-hour workshops per week, for 12 weeks. Students work in small groups (about 6) 
within workshops of about 80 students. Each workshop is run sufficient times to accommodate 
the whole cohort (anticipated 3 times). Studentsâ€™ personal timetables show them which workshops 
to attend. In each week, one workshop will be high-intensity, staffed by one lead teacher and 
four teaching assistants, and one will be low-intensity, staffed by two teaching assistants. 
The same staff members are present every week. High-intensity sessions are used for delivery 
of material that needs a high level of support. Staff set specific weekly goals to be achieved 
in low-intensity workshops and homework, to support the next high-intensity workshop. 
Low-intensity workshops are timetabled and staff to provide focus and support for the students. 
A brief summary of the provisional schedule for each week is below; a much more detailed guide 
may be found on the [Research Methods in Psychology website](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminp)

2. An experiment is born / Processing large datasets 
3. Finalizing the idea  / Building in PsychoPy
4. Finalizing the PsychoPy script / Data collection
5. One-factor ANOVA / Data collection
6. Data analysis / Preparing a presentation
7. Group presentations
8. Modifying an experiment
9. Finalizing the PsychoPy script / Data collection
10. Two-factor ANOVA / Data collection

12. Critiquing reports.

Indicative Reading List:  Mostly, the materials will be developed in-house and released under a Creative Commons licence (in the model of https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/). Primary sources (journal articles) will also form a major part of the reading, but will likely be different for each group. 

Assessment:	 Written report (80%). Group oral presentation (20%). Pass/fail Psyc:EL assessments.

Marking Criteria: Marking criteria for practical reports and group presentations will be provided on the module DLE page.

Academic Dishonesty:	University of Plymouth regulations and policies apply to this module. See also the section on Academic Dishonesty in the Stage Handbook.
