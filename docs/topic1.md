# Resarch Methods in Practice (Part 2)

# Mind wandering

## Overview

**TO DO**: Provide slides and notes sufficient for another member of academic staff to deliver a 5-minute oral introduction to your topic. Aim to engage and enthuse the students about this topic. 

There are two sub-topics:

## 1. When does our mind wander?

### Overview

Mind-wandering involves shifting the focus of our thoughts from external cues to self-generated thought. These studies show that people are less likely to do this when they are engaged in a difficult task than an easy one.
