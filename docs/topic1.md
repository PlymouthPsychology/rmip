## 1. When does our mind wander?

### Overview

Mind-wandering involves shifting the focus of our thoughts from external cues to self-generated thought. These studies show that people are less likely to do this when they are engaged in a difficult task than an easy one.

## 2. Where does our mind wander?

### Overview

Mind-wandering involves shifting the focus of our thoughts from external cues to self-generated thought. When people do this, they are more likely to focus on the future than the past.

## 3. Are we really lazy thinkers?

### Overview

People make judgments and decisions all the time and when they do so, they often do so quickly by taking short-cuts. These short-cuts are efficient and they are often accurate but sometimes they lead to a wrong or less optimal response. When we take these short-cuts it is usually assumed that to be efficient, we only attend to some superficial cues. The following papers challenge this view, showing that people do attend to additional information even when they don't use it.
