### Resources

Chris Longmore is building a [library](openses_lib.md) of OpenSesame scripts that students can access.

### High- and low-intensity sessions

Both sessions are dedicated to achieving the following goal: Have a working,
bug-checked OpenSesame script ready to go. The tasks, which they need to divide
between members of the group include: 

- Writing the instructions
- Creating the stimulus sets
- Building the structure in OpenSesame
- Testing for bugs.
- Checking the output is usable.

### Homework
