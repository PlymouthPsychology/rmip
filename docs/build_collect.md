# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

## Week 4: Build experiment and start data collection

### Resources

Chris Longmore is building a [library](openses_lib.md) of OpenSesame scripts that students can access.

### High intensity session

Whole session is dedicated to achieving the following goal: Have a working,
bug-checked OpenSesame script ready to go. The tasks, which they need to divide
between members of the group include: 

- Writing the instructions
- Creating the stimulus sets
- Building the structure in OpenSesame
- Testing for bugs.
- Checking the output is usable.

### Homework

- Complete OpenSesame script and submit it.

### Low-intensity session 

Data collection works by 5/6 of each student group participating in six
experiments. For 20 min studies, this takes 2 hours plus shifting time, so
leaves a bit of useful slack in next week's low-intesnity session, if needed.
