# Basic issues of grammar and style students get wrong

Just compiling a list at the moment; will later provide material or links on how to do this stuff properly.

- Arbitrary changing of tense

"it was found that those who were a year into their training were higher in prejudices than those who are newly recruited" 


- Anthropomorphism 

-- `This area remains ambiguous and difficult to empirically test`

- apostrophe use.

- Not knowing the difference between clauses and sentences. Which is annoying.

- `...theories as to why the police...`

- Unsure of word meaning: e.g.

-- `implemeting` versus `implicating`

-- `affect` versus `effect`
