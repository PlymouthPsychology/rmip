# Basic issues of grammar and style students get wrong

Just compiling a list at the moment; will later provide material or links on how to do this stuff properly.

- Arbitrary changing of tense

"it was found that those who were a year into their training were higher in prejudices than those who are newly recruited" 


- Anthropomorphism 

`This area remains ambiguous and difficult to empirically test`

- apostrophe use.

- Not knowing the difference between clauses and sentences. Which is annoying.

- `...theories as to why the police...`

- Unsure of word meaning: e.g.

`implemeting` versus `implicating`

`affect` versus `effect`

- Connectives: with, from, through 

"Although there is evidence that the police hold certain prejudices through
selection and socialisation effects it is important to see how these differ with the
general public."

- `et al.` is short for et alia ('and others' in Latin), so it's `et al.` not `et all` or `et al`

- Explanations versus descriptions

"Implicit bias explains bias that we have against certain groups of people which are at an unconscious level."

- Word endings:

"Police officers in the UK are racially bias towards ethnic minorities"

"not following up on a good lead about the suspects quick enough"

- Superfluous 'as to'

"The reason as to why this is such an important question..."

- Superfluous capitalisation

"the police may be Implicitly racist"

- Arbitrary/inaccurate word splitting and combining:

"performance improves overtime"

"the diet of the urban goat could include any thing from crisps to shoes"

- Theories are not causes

"Gender bias is due to Social Identity Theory"
