# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2)

## Course organization and staffing

Students work in groups of 6 within workshop classes of 80, so each class is three times to accommodate a cohort of 240 students. The course runs for 12 weeks. Throughout that time, there will be a specified teaching assistant (Ph.D student or TARA) who is the supervisor of each group as is responsible for monitoring the progress of their groups. 

Each week, students attend a two-hour _high intensity_ workshop, and a two-hour _low intensity_ workshop. 
The high-intensity workshops have a student:staff ratio of 16:1. One of those staff must be a member of academic staff (Lecturer / AP / Prof), who is expected to be present throughout the session. High-intensity sessions are where new topics are introduced, and where students can expect prompt high-quality support from topic experts, including their supervisor. 

The low-intensity workshops are staffed at 40:1 ratio, by teaching assistants. No academic staff member is present. The low-intensity sessions are where students continue to work on material introduced in the high-intensity workshops, with support that is mainly technical or procedural in nature.

## Assessment

20% - Group mark for a 10-min group oral presentation. The mark is weighted mainly on the quality of the research presented, rather than audio-visual slickness. There is a detailed quantitative markscheme.

80% - Individual mark for an individually-written 4000-word journal article. The feedback is returned in the format of a journal peer review, and the mark derived from this feedback via a detailed quantitative mark scheme.

Pass/fail - There are a set of auto-marked pass/fail competency tests for the skill-learning aspect of the course. Students can retake these as many times as they like before the deadline. They have to pass 80% of them to pass the module. 

## Resources

All sessions in 2019/20 will be run in the Psyc:EL space. The course requires one computer (PC, Mac, or Linux) per student, in all sessions, so any student with a laptop must bring it.

For activities based around R, students will continue to use the RStudio server account they were allocated at Stage 1. They should be prompted a week before the module starts to request login details if they do not have them.

For activities using Open Sesame, students will need to install this on their machine. There is time in the schedule for them to do this in class.
