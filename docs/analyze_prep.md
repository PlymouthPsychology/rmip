Note:

TA and group reprise what they did, what they have found, and discuss any
problems/limitations of what they have done. TA then leads discussion of
examples of very clear, and very unclear, lectures they have encountered since
joining Stage 1. What do these good/bad experiences have in common? Possible
issues - Rate of presentation; incorrectly assumed knowledge; over-crowded
slides; a million facts but no big picture; a big picture but no facts;
conclusions do not cleary follow from facts. Then, TA supports group to
sub-divide the task of writing a presentation between them. The sections would
be something like: (A) Big picture overview, (B) Introducing the specific
question, (C) Metholodgy, (D) Results, (E) Interpretation, (F) problems and
next steps, (G) writing an abstract. Agree an allocation of time and number of
slides each.

### Low-intensity session, and homework

- Write presentation

- Practice on other groups, TAs, and reflect.

- Submit presentation title, author names, and abstract by end of
  week. Earlier you submit, more likely you are to get your choice of session
  next week. Order within session pulled out of a hat on the day.

- Submit analysis script.
