# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

# COVID-19 Version: Weeks 9-12

On 16th March 2020, Plymouth Psychology cancelled all Stage 2 teaching with immediate effect, meaning we lost week 8 from the schedule. Weeks 9-12 are to be moved online, with Zoom video conferencing as the main tool for virtual workshops. Here's the revised plan:

### Revised Week Plan

In brief, students plan but do not run their second experiment. Multi-factor ANOVA is taught via R worksheet. 

- [Week 9: Plan Experiment 2](#9)

- [Week 10: Learn skills](#10)

- [Week 11: Start report plan](#11)

- [Week 12: Critique and finish report plan](#12)

### Revised course organization and staffing plan

High- and low-intensity workshops run at the same time, with the same staffing. However, they are virtual workshops, held on Zoom. Specifically, they are scheduled meetings.

Workshop group leaders (Clare, Michael, Chris) are responsible for scheduling Zoom meetings for their workshop group. Decide whether you want to have one meeting per workshop session (~80 students), or one meeting per TA, and send the appropriate links to the appropriate students (or ensure the TAs do so).

Staff/TAs working from the university should conduct Zoom meetings via an Ethernet (i.e. wired) rather than a WiFi (e.g. eduroam) connection where possible, as the University's WiFi is not really that great. If working from home, check you can use Zoom reliably from there well in advance of meetings.

### Revised Assessment plan

- _Presentation_: The presentation is done already. In case of ECs, refer student to Andy.

- _Psyc:EL_ : The number of activities has been reduced to 15 to reflect the change in week plan. Students must pass 12 of these to pass the module. Otherwise unaffected.

- _Report_: The report format has changed to reflect the fact study 2 is to be planned but not run. Otherwise unaffected.

## Week 9: Plan Experiment 2

<a name="9"></a>

### High intensity session

The group and TA reflect on their results, and the feedback received
on their presentation. They discuss what they would have done differently if
they were starting again. They make an assessment of how serious these
shortcomings are to drive the following decision. Should they:

(A) Run a modified version of their first experiment, mainly centered on
addressing the shortcomings of their design or results (e.g. ceiling/floor
effects).

(B) Add a between-subjects condition to their existing study that widens the
investigation to add another factor. Run that second condition in their second
data collection phase. 

If choosing B, the TA needs to clarify that adding a condition
is OK for teaching purposes but should  be avoided in research you're going
to publish. It introduces a time-of-testing confound. Between-subject
conditions should be finely intermixed. 

Students then revise their protocol.

### Low intensity session

Support for any unfinished activities.

### Homework

Submit revised protocol.

**EASTER BREAK**

## Week 10: Learn skills and finish data collection

### High-intensity session

Whole session dedicated to two-factor ANOVA. There are two worksheets,
[Understanding interactions](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/anova2.html) (60
minutes) and [Factorial
differences](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/anova3.html) (40 min), so
perhaps encourage students to take a break after the first worksheet.

### Low intensity session

Support for any unfinished activities.

### Homework

- Submit ANOVA exercises.

## Week 11: Start report plan

### Teachers' resources

Here are some [slides](report-writing.odp) on report writing I put together for a similar course at Exeter about a decade ago. They might be helpful in developing materials here. These resources may also be helpful in putting presentation and support materials together.

- [APA referencing guide](https://plymouth.libguides.com/APA)

- [Common issues of grammar and style](grammar.html)

### High-intensity session

| min | Contents                                                          |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 000 | Teacher presentation report writing                               |
| 030 | With TA support, write and submit a bullet point plan for the report. If time, move on to elaboration of report writing, referencing, grammar, and style -- see above. |
| 110 | Finish                                                            |

### Low-intensity session

Support for any unfinished activities and report writing

### Homework

- Read the good/bad reports used in Week 12.

## Week 12: Critique and finish report plan

### High intensity session

| min | Content                                              |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|
| 000 | TA-led good-and-bad reports activity (see Note 1)    |
| 050 | BREAK                                                |
| 060 | TA-led discussion of bullet point plans (see Note 2) |
| 110 | Finish                                               |

Note 1: Groups are given one example 1st class and one example 2ii report. The
1st class example is already available - see model answer, AW will provide a
2ii version of this same report). Can they tell why those two reports
differed in mark? What are the good points of the 1st class report? Where did
the 2ii report go wrong?

Note 2: All groups working with a TA get together.  Each group, with an
audience of that TA's other two groups, talks through their bullet point
plan. TA and other groups provide feedback on what they found clear / unclear.

### Low-intensity session

Final open Q&A, and support session, so students are best prepared to write their
report.

### Homework

Write the report.
