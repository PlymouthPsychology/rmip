## Week 12: Critique and finish report plan

### High intensity session

| min | Content                                              |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|
| 000 | TA-led good-and-bad reports activity (see Note 1)    |
| 050 | BREAK                                                |
| 060 | TA-led discussion of bullet point plans (see Note 2) |


Note 1: Groups are given one example 1st class and one example 2ii report (we
would put these together ourselves by coming up with an imaginary study,
writing it up well, and then breaking it). Can they tell why those two reports
differed in mark? What are the good points of the 1st class report? Where did
the 2ii report go wrong?

Note 2: All groups working with a TA get together.  Each group, with an
audience of that TA's other two groups, talks through their bullet point
plan. TA and other groups provide feedback on what they found clear / unclear.

### Low-intensity session

An open Q&A, and support session, so students are best prepared to write their
report.

### Homework

Write the report.
