# Research Methods in Practice 2

_Andy Wills, Clare Walsh, Michael Verde, Julien Besle_

In this course, you'll get a guided introduction to doing research as a team. Across weekly two-hour workshops, you'll go through the whole _research cycle_. You'll pick a topic (from a list), plan a study, build an experiment, collect data, analyze that data, and give a group presentation on your findings. You'll then write up the whole thing in journal article format. The focus is on learning a few techniques well, and getting lots of practice in those techniques. You'll learn how to do good, open, reproducible science, and you'll be well prepared for the research methods components of your final year. 

The reason that we get you to pick a topic from a pre-approved list, rather than give you a free choice, is that (a) this maximises the chance of your topic working (i.e. producing clear interpretable results with the sample size available), and (b) ensures your topic is suitable as an illustration of the key statistical and research methods concepts covered in this module. In next year's dissertation, when you have largely completed your basic research methods training, the choice of topic will be less restricted. 

## Before the course begins

One week before this course begins, you must:

1. Check you can log into [RStudio online](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk), and resolve this issue with the Tech Office if you cannot.

2. Complete the R [revision worksheet](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/revision.html), as this course assumes this particular information will be fresh in your mind. It should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.

If you ever want to look back at earlier materials on R, you can find them all on the main [RMINR](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr) site. On that site, Part 1 and 2 are the Stage 1 materials, Part 3 is a a briefer version of Stage 1 for revision purposes, and Parts 4 and 5 are the Stage 2 materials.
