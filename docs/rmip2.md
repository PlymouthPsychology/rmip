# Research Methods in Practice 2

_Andy Wills, Clare Walsh, Chris Longmore, Michael Verde_

In this course, you'll get a guided introduction to doing research as a team. Across weekly two-hour workshops, you'll go through the whole _research cycle_. You'll pick a topic (from a list), plan a study, build an experiment, collect data, analyze that data, and give a group presentation on your findings. You'll then write up the whole thing in journal article format. The focus is on learning a few techniques well, and getting lots of practice in those techniques. You'll learn how to do good, open, reproducible science, and you'll be well prepared for the research methods components of your final year. 

## Before the course begins

One week before this course begins, you must:

1. Check you can log into [RStudio online](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk), and resolve this issue with the Tech Office if you cannot.

2. Complete the R [revision worksheet](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/revision.html), as this course assumes this particular information will be fresh in your mind. It should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.

If you ever want to look back at earlier materials on R, you can find them all on the main [RMINR](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr) site. On that site, Part 1 and 2 are the Stage 1 materials, Part 3 is a a briefer version of Stage 1 for revision purposes, and Parts 4 and 5 are the Stage 2 materials.
