# Research Methods in Practice 2

_Andy Wills, Clare Walsh, Chris Longmore, Michael Verde_

In this course, you'll get a guided introduction to doing research as a team. Across twenty-three two-hour workshops and 12 weeks, you'll go through the whole _research cycle_ twice. You'll pick a topic (from a list), plan a study, build an experiment, collect data, analyze that data, and give a group presentation on your initial findings. You'll then modify your design in response to feedback, collect and analyze more data, and write up the whole thing in journal article format. The focus is on learning a few techniques well, and getting lots of practice in those techniques. You'll learn how to do good, open, reproducible science, and you'll be well prepared for the research methods components of your final year. 

**Bring your own laptop to every session if you have one, ensuring it is fully charged and that you have several gigabytes of space left on your hard drive.** A limited number of laptops are available for loan to those who do not have one.

## Before the course begins

One week before this course begins, you must:

1. Check you can log into [RStudio online](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk), and resolve this issue with the Tech Office if you cannot.

2. Complete the R [revision worksheet](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/revision.html), as this course assumes this particular information will be fresh in your mind. It should take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.
