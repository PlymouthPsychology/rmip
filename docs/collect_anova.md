### Notes on data collection

Data collection works by 5/6 of each student group participating in six experiments. Studies take 20 min. So, in 20 min, each group simultaneously tests five people on five different laptops, with the sixth member being the experimenter for their study. Then the 5/6th of each group move to another experiment, and so on. This collects 15 participants per hour per group.
