# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

## Week 2: Define question, outline design and learn skills

### Teachers' resources

Here are some [slides](expt-design.odp) on experimental design written about a decade ago for the Exeter Stage 2 practicals. They might be useful for developing materials for Weeks 2 and 3 of this module. 

### High instensity session
