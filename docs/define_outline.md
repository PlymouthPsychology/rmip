# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

## Week 2: Define question, outline design and learn skills

### Teachers' resources

Here are some [slides](expt-design.odp) on experimental design written about a decade ago for the Exeter Stage 2 practicals. They might be useful for developing materials for Weeks 2 and 3 of this module. 


### High intensity session

| 020 | With TA support, groups define question and plan broad design          |
| 050 | BREAK                          |
| 060 |  Start [Data preprocessing](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/preproc.html) worksheet. If they have not already tried out the facial prototypes experiment in OpenSesame, they should skip this part, otherwise they will run out of time                         |
| 110 | Finish                                                                 |

Allow some flexibility in timing after the break, depending on how much help the groups need with the broad design and with the data preprocessing worksheet. Bear in mind that help on the broad design is more easily got at the high-intensity session, as all TAs are present at these sessions (but not at the low-intensity session). 

### Low-intensity session, and homework

**It might be a good idea, for this one week, to staff the low-intensity session more heavily, perhaps 25:1**. This is because the preprocessing exercise is not easy, and probably isn't completable within the high-intensity session.

- Complete data preprocessing worksheet (allow around 40 minutes for this).

- Complete and submit one-page broad design summary.
