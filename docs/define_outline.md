# Research Methods in Practice (Part 2) - Teachers' notes

## Week 2: Define question, outline design and learn skills

### Teachers' resources

Here are some [slides](expt-design.odp) on experimental design written about a decade ago for the Exeter Stage 2 practicals. They might be useful for developing materials for Weeks 2 and 3 of this module. 

### High instensity session

| 020 | With TA support, groups define question and plan broad design          |
| 050 | BREAK                          |
| 060 |  Start [Data preprocessing](https://ajwills72.github.io/rminr/preproc.html) worksheet. If they have not already tried out the facial prototypes experiment in OpenSesame, they should skip this part, otherwise they will run out of time                         |

### Low-intensity session, and homework

**It might be a good idea, for this one week, to staff the low-intensity session more heavily, perhaps 20:1**. This is because the preprocessing exercise is not easy, and probably isn't completable within the high-intensity session.

- Complete and submit one-page broad design summary.

- Complete data preprocessing worksheet.

- Complete data preprocessing pass/fail competency assessment.
